	  <p>I decided to make this website because I love learning different programming languages.
    After watching an hour long YouTube video on Flask web development I decided to give it a go.
    I recently began using Python and it's crazy how easy it is to use.</p>

	  <p>I will be writing tutorials for everything I learn so I can reference back to them and
	     help others who may need it. I plan on creating tutorials for Python, Visual Basic, C++, Java
       and for Microsoft Windows.</p>

    <p>If there is something your stuggling with and would like me to write a tutorial just click the
      contact button and let me know.</p>
