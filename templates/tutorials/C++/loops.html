	<p>With loops we can run groups of statements any number of times as long as a condition is true.</p>
	<p>There are three main types of loops:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>while</li>
		<li>do While</li>
		<li>for</li>
	
	<h3>while Loop</h3>
		<p>If you'd like to repeat blocks of code an unknown number of times while a boolean condition is true, you'll likely be using a while loop.</p>
		
		<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp">
int i = 0;

while(i <= 10) {
    cout << i << endl;
    i += 1;
} 
</code></pre>

<p> In the above example we created an integer variable and set it to 0. The code inside the while loop is executed until <code>i is greater than 10</code>.</p>

<h3>do While</h3>
<p>The do While loop is very similar to the while loop, however, with a do while loop, the loop will always execute one time. Have a look at the example below.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp">
int i = 20;

do {
   cout << "Inside the loop" << endl;
} while (i <= 10);
</code></pre>
<p>We defined an integer variable i and set it equal to 20 and tell the loop to print <code>Inside the loop</code> as long as <code>i is less than 20</code>. Now we know i is
set to 20, but the statement is going to print to the screen one time anyway.</p>

<h3>for</h3>
<p>You would most likely use a for loop if you know exactly how many times you'd like to execute a block of code.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-cpp">
for(int i=0; i<5; i++) {
    cout << i << endl;
}
</code></pre>
	  <p>In this example we set <code>i equal to 0</code> and we want to loop until <code>i is greater than or equal to 5</code> and every time it loops we increment i to 1 by using <code>i++</code></p>
